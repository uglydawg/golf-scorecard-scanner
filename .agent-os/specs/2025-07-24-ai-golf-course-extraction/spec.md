# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: AI-Powered Golf Course Data Extraction
> Created: 2025-07-24
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Enhance the existing OCR processing pipeline with advanced AI-powered data extraction capabilities that automatically populate comprehensive golf course data from scorecard images. This feature will improve extraction accuracy from 85% to 95%+ while adding support for enhanced data validation, multi-tee box recognition, and player score extraction.

## User Stories

### Enhanced Course Data Extraction

As a golf app developer, I want the OCR system to extract comprehensive course metadata (architect, established year, location details) and multiple tee box configurations from a single scorecard image, so that I can populate complete course profiles without manual data entry.

The enhanced system will automatically identify different tee boxes (Championship, Middle, Forward, Ladies), extract par values, handicap rankings, yardages, course ratings, and slope ratings for each tee configuration, then structure this data to match our database schema perfectly.

### Player Score Integration  

As a golf application user, I want to upload a completed scorecard photo and have the system automatically extract all player scores hole-by-hole, so that my round data is captured without manual entry.

The AI will identify handwritten or printed scores in player columns, validate them against par values, and structure the output to directly populate round_scores tables with player names and individual hole scores.

### Intelligent Data Validation

As a product manager, I want the AI system to perform comprehensive validation of extracted golf data against USGA standards and logical constraints, so that only high-quality, accurate course information enters our database.

The system will validate par values (3-6 per hole), ensure handicap arrays contain unique values 1-18, verify course ratings fall within realistic ranges (67.0-77.0), and flag any anomalous data for human review.

## Spec Scope

1. **Enhanced AI Prompt Engineering** - Implement comprehensive JSON schema-based prompts that extract structured course data, tee box information, and player scores with 95%+ accuracy
2. **Multi-Tee Box Recognition** - Automatically identify and extract data for multiple tee configurations (Men's/Ladies', Championship/Middle/Forward) from a single scorecard
3. **Advanced Data Validation** - Implement USGA-compliant validation rules for par values, handicap rankings, course ratings, slope ratings, and player scores
4. **Player Score Extraction** - Add capability to extract handwritten/printed player scores and structure them for round_scores table population
5. **Enhanced Course Metadata** - Extract comprehensive course information including architect, established year, location details, and course descriptions

## Out of Scope

- Web scraping or external API integration for course data verification
- Image preprocessing improvements beyond existing capabilities  
- Real-time processing or queue-based background processing
- Multi-language OCR support beyond English
- Tournament-specific scorecard layouts or non-standard formats

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Enhanced OCR Service** - Updated OcrService with improved prompts that extract structured JSON matching the specified schema with 95%+ field accuracy
2. **Comprehensive Data Validation** - Validation logic that ensures all extracted golf data meets USGA standards and database constraints
3. **Multi-Tee Support** - System can process scorecards with multiple tee boxes and create separate course records for each tee configuration
4. **Player Score Processing** - Capability to extract player names and hole-by-hole scores, formatting them for direct database insertion
