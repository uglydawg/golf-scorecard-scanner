## Overview

Transform the existing Golf Scorecard Scanner Laravel application into a reusable Laravel package with proper Composer structure, service provider, and configuration publishing capabilities. This enables other Laravel developers to easily integrate the scorecard scanning functionality into their golf applications.

## User Stories

### Laravel Package Integration

As a Laravel developer building a golf application, I want to install the scorecard scanner as a Composer package, so that I can quickly add OCR-based scorecard processing to my app without having to build it from scratch.

The developer runs `composer require vendor/golf-scorecard-scanner`, publishes the configuration and migrations, and immediately has access to scorecard scanning APIs and services. They can customize OCR providers, file storage paths, and confidence thresholds through published configuration files.

### Package Maintainer Story

As a package maintainer, I want the package to follow Laravel package development best practices, so that it integrates seamlessly with any Laravel application and provides a consistent developer experience.

The package includes service provider auto-discovery, publishable assets, proper namespace organization, and comprehensive documentation. It works across different Laravel versions and doesn't conflict with existing application code.

### Package Consumer Story

As a developer using the package, I want clear configuration options and migration publishing, so that I can customize the package behavior for my specific use case while maintaining upgrade compatibility.

Published configuration allows customizing OCR providers, storage disks, table prefixes, and processing parameters. Migrations can be published and modified if needed for custom table structures.

## Spec Scope

1. **Composer Package Structure** - Convert app structure to standard Laravel package format with src/ directory and proper autoloading
2. **Service Provider Implementation** - Create service provider with auto-discovery for registering services, routes, and configuration
3. **Configuration Publishing** - Publishable config files for OCR providers, storage settings, and processing parameters
4. **Migration Publishing** - Allow host applications to publish and customize database migrations
5. **Namespace Organization** - Proper PSR-4 namespace structure for all classes and interfaces

## Out of Scope

- Packagist publication and versioning (handled in separate spec)
- Breaking changes to existing API interfaces
- Documentation website creation
- Example application development

## Expected Deliverable

1. Package can be installed via Composer in any Laravel application
2. All services and functionality work identically to current application
3. Configuration and migrations can be published and customized by host applications
