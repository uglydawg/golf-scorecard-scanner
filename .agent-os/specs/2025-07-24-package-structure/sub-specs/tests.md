# Tests Specification

This is the tests coverage details for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-07-24-package-structure/spec.md

> Created: 2025-07-24
> Version: 1.0.0

## Test Coverage

### Unit Tests

**Service Provider Tests**
- Test service provider registration and discovery
- Test configuration publishing functionality
- Test migration publishing functionality
- Test route registration
- Test service binding in container

**Package Structure Tests**
- Test PSR-4 autoloading works correctly
- Test all classes can be instantiated with proper namespaces
- Test configuration loading from published files
- Test environment variable overrides work

### Integration Tests

**Package Installation**
- Test composer install process in fresh Laravel app
- Test service provider auto-discovery
- Test configuration publishing command
- Test migration publishing command
- Test package works after installation

**Backward Compatibility**
- Test all existing API endpoints still function
- Test authentication still works with Sanctum
- Test file upload and processing pipeline unchanged
- Test database operations work with published migrations
- Test service injection works with new namespaces

**Configuration Integration**
- Test OCR provider switching via configuration
- Test storage disk configuration changes
- Test confidence threshold configuration
- Test file size and type restrictions via config

### Feature Tests

**End-to-End Package Usage**
- Install package in fresh Laravel app
- Publish configuration and migrations
- Run migrations
- Test complete scorecard upload and processing workflow
- Verify response format matches original application

**Multi-Environment Testing**
- Test package works in development environment
- Test package works with different database drivers (SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL)
- Test package works with different Laravel versions (11+)
- Test package works with different PHP versions (8.2+)

### Mocking Requirements

**File System Operations**
- Mock file publishing during service provider tests
- Mock configuration file creation and reading
- Mock migration file publishing

**External Dependencies**
- Mock Composer operations during installation tests
- Mock Laravel application container for service provider tests
- Mock file system operations for config publishing

**Time-Based Tests**
- Mock file timestamps for migration publishing tests
- Mock current date for package version testing

## Test Strategy

### Package Testing Approach
1. **Isolated Unit Tests**: Test each component (service provider, configuration, etc.) in isolation
2. **Integration Tests**: Test package installation and integration with fresh Laravel applications
3. **Compatibility Tests**: Ensure backward compatibility with existing functionality
4. **Cross-Environment Tests**: Verify package works across different Laravel and PHP versions

### Test Database Strategy
- Use SQLite in-memory database for fast unit tests
- Use transaction rollback strategy for test isolation
- Test with multiple database drivers to ensure compatibility
- Mock external OCR services to avoid API dependencies

### Continuous Integration Considerations
- Test matrix for Laravel 11+ and PHP 8.2+
- Test package installation from scratch
- Test configuration publishing in CI environment
- Verify no breaking changes to existing API contracts

## Test Implementation Notes

### Package-Specific Test Requirements
- Tests must verify package works when installed via Composer
- Tests must verify service provider auto-discovery
- Tests must verify configuration publishing creates correct files
- Tests must verify namespace changes don't break existing functionality

### Backward Compatibility Testing
- All existing test cases must continue to pass
- API response formats must remain identical
- Database schema must remain compatible
- Service injection must work with new namespaces

### Installation Testing
- Create fresh Laravel application in test environment
- Install package via Composer
- Publish configuration and migrations
- Run complete test suite against installed package
