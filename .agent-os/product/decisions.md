## 2025-07-24: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Development Team

### Decision

Golf Scorecard Scanner will be developed as a Laravel package that provides OCR-based extraction of golf course data from scorecard images, targeting golf app developers who need to populate course databases automatically.

### Context

Golf applications frequently require comprehensive course data, but manual entry creates user friction and existing golf course APIs are expensive or have limited coverage. The rise of OCR technology and machine learning makes automated scorecard processing viable, while the Laravel ecosystem provides an ideal platform for rapid adoption by PHP developers.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **SaaS API Service**
   - Pros: Language agnostic, easier to maintain, recurring revenue
   - Cons: Network dependency, more complex billing, higher barrier to adoption

2. **Mobile SDK Only**
   - Pros: Direct user interaction, native camera integration
   - Cons: Platform-specific development, limited to mobile apps, harder to distribute

3. **Generic OCR Package**
   - Pros: Broader market appeal, simpler implementation
   - Cons: Less accuracy for golf-specific data, no domain expertise, commodity pricing

### Rationale

Laravel package approach provides the best balance of developer experience, integration simplicity, and market positioning. The golf-specific domain knowledge creates a strong competitive moat while Laravel's ecosystem ensures rapid adoption among PHP developers.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Deep Laravel integration enables faster development for users
- Golf-specific intelligence provides superior accuracy vs generic OCR
- Package distribution model reduces infrastructure costs
- Crowdsourced verification creates network effects

**Negative:**
- Limited to PHP/Laravel ecosystem
- Requires local infrastructure for image processing
- Dependency on third-party OCR providers for core functionality

## 2025-07-24: Technical Architecture

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Technical Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Implement service-oriented architecture with strict PHP typing, Laravel Sanctum authentication, and multi-provider OCR integration supporting OCR.space, Google Vision, and AWS Textract.

### Context

The application requires robust image processing, reliable OCR extraction, and secure file handling. Laravel 12 with PHP 8.4 provides modern language features while maintaining compatibility with existing Laravel applications.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Single OCR Provider**
   - Pros: Simpler implementation, fewer dependencies
   - Cons: Vendor lock-in, single point of failure, limited fallback options

2. **Synchronous Processing Only**
   - Pros: Simpler architecture, immediate results
   - Cons: Poor user experience for large files, scaling limitations

### Rationale

Multi-provider OCR approach ensures reliability and allows users to choose based on cost/accuracy preferences. Service architecture enables easy testing and future enhancements while maintaining clean separation of concerns.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Flexibility in OCR provider selection
- Robust error handling and fallback options
- Clean architecture enables easy testing and maintenance
- Queue-ready design supports future scaling

**Negative:**
- Increased complexity in provider management
- Multiple API keys required for full functionality
- Higher development overhead for provider abstraction

## 2025-07-24: Package Distribution Strategy

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Business
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Marketing

### Decision

Distribute as open-source Laravel package via Packagist with MIT license, focusing on developer adoption over immediate monetization.

### Context

Laravel ecosystem thrives on open-source packages, and developer trust is crucial for adoption. The golf app market is niche but growing, with many independent developers building golf-related applications.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Commercial License Only**
   - Pros: Direct revenue generation, higher perceived value
   - Cons: Adoption barrier, requires sales infrastructure, limits community contributions

2. **Freemium Model**
   - Pros: Revenue potential with broad adoption base
   - Cons: Complex feature gating, support overhead, unclear value proposition

### Rationale

Open-source approach maximizes adoption potential in Laravel community while allowing future commercial offerings (enterprise features, hosted services, consulting) as market develops.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Rapid adoption through Laravel community
- Community contributions improve package quality
- Establishes market presence and thought leadership
- Foundation for future commercial opportunities

**Negative:**
- No immediate revenue generation
- Support obligations without direct compensation
- Risk of competitors building on open-source foundation
